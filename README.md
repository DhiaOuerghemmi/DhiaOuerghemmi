As a new computer science student, I am deeply fascinated by the potential of AI and big data to transform the world. Although I am just beginning my journey in this field, I am eager to learn and develop my skills. I have started exploring Python and data science fundamentals, and I am currently working on small projects to build a strong foundation. My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects in AI and big data as I continue to grow and expand my knowledge. I am enthusiastic about collaborating with others and learning from every experience.
